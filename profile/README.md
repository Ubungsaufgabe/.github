# Ubungsaufgabe
This organization and project is for an exercise I'm doing for GitHub. What does _Ubungsaufgabe_ mean? I'm not sure if this is correct, but I'm learning German and I just combined a few words so roughly it means _exercise task_. 

## Instructions
This organization is (almost!) set up to automatically apply branch protection rules and notify me (organization owner), but potentially the security team once I figure out that action. 

The goals of this repository is to help organize the parent organization _Ubungsaufgabe_ for the following goals:
- Self-service: anyone can create a new repository
- New repositories always get (initial) default settings
- Some repository settings cannot be changed
