# Ubungsaufgabe
This organization and project is for an exercise I'm doing for GitHub. What does _Ubungsaufgabe_ mean? I'm not sure if this is correct, but I'm learning German and I just combined a few words so roughly it means _exercise task_. 

## Instructions
Grab the `core` repository and you should be able to do much of what is needed to automate the organization's pull request needs.
